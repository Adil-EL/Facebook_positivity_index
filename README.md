# Socail_media_positivity_index
Evrybody is attached in a way or in another to his smart phone and his social media accounts, 
the content he consums affect directly the user's life.
Our mood is, to some extent, controlled by what we see, we hear or read. 
sometimes without even knowing, our social media accounts become very toxic and negatively impact our lives.
as modern problems require modern solutions, the aim of this project is help you as a user have an idea about how positive your feed is, and how it will eventually impact your day to day decisions.

By analyzing the content you consum (based on the content of pages you follow, what your friends share, to which content you react the most), we are going to score the positivity of your feed, hence your mood.
Stay tonned for the first release !
